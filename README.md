# Frontend a project LandingPad

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate

# deploy
$ npm run publishToHeroku
```

The `draft` folder is for pages and components with a lot of functionality that are not used.
Since the code is commented out, `tree-shaking` will prevent the commented code from getting into the `build`.

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).
